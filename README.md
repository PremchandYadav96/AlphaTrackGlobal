```bash
git clone https://github.com/PremchandYadav96/AlphaTrackGlobal.git
cd AlphaTrackGlobal
```

**Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 3: Install Required Libraries**

**Step 4: Configure the API Key**
Open the `portfolio_dashboard.py` file in your code editor. Find the following line and replace the placeholder with your actual NewsAPI key:
```python
# Line 23 in portfolio_dashboard.py
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your key```

**Step 5: Run the Streamlit App**
